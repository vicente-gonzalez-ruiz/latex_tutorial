The equivalence of energy $E$ and mass $m$ is reliant on the speed of
light $c$ and is described by
\begin{equation}
  E=mc^2.
  \label{eq:emc}
\end{equation}
Equation~\ref{eq:emc} was found by Albert Einstin in 1905.

Also equations without equation numbers such as:
\begin{equation*}
  \sin(x)^2 + \cos(x)^2 = 1
\end{equation*}
are also possible.

In-line math $y=\sqrt{x}$ is also possible.
